In general programming we use different concepts like
 - Control Statements(If, If-Else, Break, Continue, For Loop, While Loop, Do-While Loop)
 
 - Operators are use to perform operations on values 
 - Operators are of different types :
 	- Assignment
 	- Arithmetic
 	- Logical
 	- Bitwise
 	- Relational
 	- Conditional/Ternary
 	
 - Data types = As java is static language type checking is done during compile time.
   Data types are of 2 types :
 	- Primitive (byte, char, short, int, float, long, double)
 	- NonPrimitive (String, Class, Interface, Object)
