Interface is keyword.
We can declare method signature only but not implementation.
By default all interface methods are abstract.
If any class implements interface then class should be override all interface methods otherwise the class will be showing compile time error.
We cannot create object to interface but we can create reference to it.
We can declare variables inside interface by default they are public static final.
Java will support multiple inheritance through interfaces.
One class can implement interfaces.
One interface can extend interfaces.
Interface can be created with out methods, these are called as Marker Interface.
Examples of Marker Interface are cloneable, serializable.
