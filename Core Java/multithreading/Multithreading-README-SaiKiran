Thread is a light weight sub process.
Threads share same memory area.
Multi threading is where multiple threads will perform operations simultaneously by reducing CPU idle time.
Synchronization is used to solve data inconsistency problem.
Synchronization is control of access of multiple threads through any shared resource(object), so each thread will perform operations linearly one after other. 
We can achieve synchronization in 2 ways : 
 - Method level
 - Block level
