In java a string is a sequence of characters, often used to represent text.
String are objects in java & instance of string class which is part of java.lang.package.
Key features of string in java
	a)Immutable : Once a string object is created it cannot be changed.
	b)Any modification to string creates a new string object
Java optimizes memory usage by storing strings in a special way area of memory called “String Constant Pool”.
If two strings have same value and are created without using new keyword they will refer to same object in string pool.
Methods in String class are non-synchronized.
String methods are : 
	length()
	trim()
	toLowerCase()
	toUpperCase()
	append()
	indexOf()
	strip()
String contains() method is used to check whether substring is present or not.
String replace() method is used to replace other values
ix.String reverse() method is used to reverse the string
String concat() method is used to reverse the string
Split method is used to split the sentence into words.
	- Using for loop
	- Using for each loop
We can create string using in two ways :
	- Using String literals
	- Using new keyword
xiiiIn string
	- equals() is used to compare the content
	- == is used to compare the memory of the two objects
StringBuffer :
   StringBuffer is a final class.
   StringBuffer are mutable.
   String class consists of methods.
   Methods in StringBuffer class are synchronized.
StringBuffer methods :  
	append() - used to combine the two strings into one String
	insert() - to insert the string into the present string based on the index value
	reverse() - to reverse the string ,replace-replace the string with other string based on starting index and ending index
	delete() - to delete the sub string or string from the existing string based on starting index and ending index.
	
StringBuilder :
   String Builder is a final class.
   StringBuilder are mutable.
   StringBuilder class consists of methods.
