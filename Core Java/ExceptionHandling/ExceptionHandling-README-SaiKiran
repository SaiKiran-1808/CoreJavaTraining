Exception handling is a mechanism.
Exceptions are in built mechanisms of java.
All exception are executed while abnormal conditions only.
It wont execute any exceptions in normal flow.
Once any exceptions are occurring in java code then remaining lines of code is unreachable.  
Java.lang.Throwable is super class for exceptions and errors.
There are 2 types of exceptions 
	I. Checked Exceptions
	II. Unchecked Exceptions
All checked exceptions are compile time exceptions.
All Unchecked exceptions are run time exceptions.
There are 5 keywords in Exception handling
 	I. try
	II. catch
	III. finally
	IV. throws
	V. throw
Try is for business logic.
Catch is for handling exceptions.
Finally is block if exception occurs or not finally block will be executed.
Throws an exception is transferred from method to method.
Throw is for runtime exceptions will call predefined exception classes and user defined exceptions..
Try followed by either catch or final block.
We should follow exception hierarchy.
We can create our own user defined exceptions.
Our own exceptions extend Exception or Runtime exceptions.
All exception classes into java.lang package.
If there are 2 exceptions in class developer should handle 1st exception then 2nd exception will be handled next.
Errors are not in developer control.
We can declare multiple exceptions with throws keyword.
We can also use multi catch exception where we put multiple exceptions in catch with OR or pipe symbol.
We can use try inside try called as nested try block.
