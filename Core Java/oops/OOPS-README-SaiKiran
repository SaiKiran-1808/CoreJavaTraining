OOPS - Object Oriented Programming System
It is a paradigm which follows bottom to approach.
In daily life we use many objects, so OOPS solve many real time problems.
OOPS contains :
	- Class : It is blue print to create objects and logical entity.
	- Object : It is an instance of a class and real world entity.
Object is combination of attributes and methods.
	- Attributes : It is used to define the state of objects. 
	- Methods : It is used to define the behaviour of objects.
	
OOPS has 4 pillars 
	- Inheritance
	- Polymorphism
	- Abstraction
	- Encapsulation
